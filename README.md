# recipes_website (My first time using Github alongside developing a website)

During the coursde of this section of The Odin Project (that requires me to make this website), I'll be using version control and exrecising the concepts I have learned to apply thus far.

# Plan + Skills

I want to keep referring to this website again until I am done with the Odin project. I want to watch it grow as I learn new comncepts and one day look back on my first few commits while learning.
